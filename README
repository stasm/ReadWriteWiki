=== ReadWriteWiki

ReadWriteWiki is a wiki that's designed to be very easy to deploy and maintain. It's inspired by the original WikiWikiWeb from 1995. All pages are editable by all users.

ReadWriteWiki is written as a single-file PHP application. All the data is stored in a single-file SQLite3 database.

--- Getting Started

 $ curl -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stasm/ReadWriteWiki/main/index.php
 $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stasm/ReadWriteWiki/main/schema.sql | sqlite3 wiki.db

That's it.

--- Optional Configuration

Adjust `DB_NAME` at the top of `index.php` if the SQLite database file has a different name or path.

You can also customize the names of some of the wiki pages: the home page, the help page, and the special page listing the wiki's recent changes.

--- Server Configuration

ReadWriteWiki is designed to be deployed by simply copying `index.php` onto the server. No additional setup is required as long as the server supports PHP.

If needed, configure Nginx to recognize PHP files. For example:

 server {
 	# ...
 
 	index index.php index.html;
 
 	location ~ \.php$ {
 		include fastcgi_params;
 		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
 		fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
 	}
 }
